# Linear_Regression_Using_GradientDescent
This program is all about implementing Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

#Linear Regression
Linear Regression is used to model relationship between dependent and one or more Independent variable. The variables must have continous values.

The equation of line is $y = m * x + c$
